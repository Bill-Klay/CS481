### CS481 Data Science
---------------------------------------------------

This repository contains labs and assignments from the Data Sciences course that needed collaboration. Feel free to pull and merge. Currently the repository contains:
##### 1. Lab 4 folder
Lab 4 submission with a python notebook containing implementation of K Nearest neighbors plus a function containing my own implementation. This is the complete lab with all the questions.
> You can find a lot better implementations of KNN on many parts of the internet. This one has NxM complexity where *N=number of samples* and *M=number of test samples* implemented in bare bones python. 
##### 2. Assignment 1 Folder
A LaTeX file for summaries on the research papers described in the assignment. Research papers particularly being *"Human Centric Data Cleansing"* and *"Data Cleansing tools"* OpenRefine and Knime along with screenshots.

... more on way...
