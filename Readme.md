### CS481 Data Science
===================================================

This repository contains labs and assignments from the Data Sciences course that needed collaboration. Currently the repository contains:
1. Lab 4 submission with a python notebook containing implementation of K Nearest neighbors plus a function containing my own implementation (which is really expensive computational wise). This is the complete lab with all the questions. Feel free to edit and pull
2. A LaTeX file for summaries on the research papers described in the assignment. Research papers particularly being "Human Centric Data Cleansing" and "Data Cleansing tools" (which is still to be comitted).

... more on way...
