### CS481 Data Science
===================================================

This repository contains labs and assignments from the Data Sciences course that needed collaboration. Currently the repository contains:
1. Lab 4 submission with a python notebook containing implementation of K Nearest neighbors plus a function containing my own implementation (which is really expensive computational wise). This is the complete lab with all the questions. Feel free to edit and pull.
> You can find a lot better implementations of KNN on many parts of the internet. This one has NxM complexity where *N=number of samples* and *M=number of test samples* implemented in bare bones python. 
2. A LaTeX file for summaries on the research papers described in the assignment. Research papers particularly being *"Human Centric Data Cleansing"* and *"Data Cleansing tools"* (which is still to be comitted).

... more on way...
