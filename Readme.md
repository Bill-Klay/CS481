## CS481 Data Science
---------------------------------------------------

This repository contains labs and assignments from the Data Sciences course that needed collaboration. Feel free to pull and merge. Currently the repository contains:

#### 1. Lab 4 Folder
Lab 4 submission with a python notebook containing implementation of K Nearest neighbors plus a function containing my own implementation. This is the complete lab with all the questions.
> You can find a lot better implementations of KNN on many parts of the internet. This one has NxM complexity where *N=number of samples* and *M=number of test samples* implemented in bare bones python. 

#### 2. Assignment 1 Folder
A LaTeX file for summaries on the research papers described in the assignment. Research papers particularly being *"Human Centric Data Cleansing"* and *"Data Cleansing tools"* OpenRefine and Knime along with screenshots.

#### 3. Lab 5 Folder
Decisions Tree lab containing comparision between Cross Validation and Hold Out approach based on 5 datasets obtained from UCI Machine Learning Dataset Database. 

### 4. Lab 6 Folder
Naive Bayes implementation in Python from scratch

### 5. Assignment 2
Well if you're seeing this *Covod-19* has hit pretty hard here. Work is slow, but making progress nonetheless. Assignment 2 was a written assignment hence pictures for the solutions are [linked](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YELMxK_9zSbmMw2nxg5Dxf7DoALYuNZ6/view?usp=sharing) to my Google Drive

### 6. Assignment 3
Implements *KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and SVM*(Gaussian kernel i.e. rbf and Chi-Squared kernel) classifiers in Python with data obtained from UCI Irvine Machine Learning dataset repository. Examples have been calculated on the Flag and balance scale dataset.

... more on way...
